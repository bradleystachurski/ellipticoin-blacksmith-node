Elipticoin Blacksmith Node
==========

Elipticoin is a Ethereum-like blockchain that's optimized for sustainability and
developer happiness. [Stakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) run
blacksmith nodes to form consensus on transactions on the network in return for
staking rewards. This is the reference implementation of a
blacksmith node written in Elixir and Rust.

You can access the Elipticoin network using the [reference wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ec-wallet).
